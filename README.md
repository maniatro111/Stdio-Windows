Florin Postolache - 335CC

Organisation:

    Each field in the structure is explained in the .c file.
    My implementation was pretty direct, I think. I just implemented each
function in the order specified by the checker.
    I consider that the homework was pretty interesting and nice.
    I consider my implementation pretty lazy and naive, but it works.
    I don't think I've met any special cases that were not specified in
the text of the homework. Maybe I've included them without knowing.
    For some reason I get a code style error on line 32 and I don't know why.

Implementation:

    I've implemented everythin till I met the popen in Windows. I tried to 
make it. It blocked the checker, so I decided to erase it.
    I've not implemented any extra things.
    The solution compiles by copying the archive in a folder, entering
that folder and typing the command make. Then we need to add the 
dynamic library to the library path. We can then run any executable
that uses this library to check if it works.
